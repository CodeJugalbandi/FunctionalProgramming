# The expression problem in FP

### Classes translate to...

**BRAMHA** In OO, we model our domain concepts by creating our own types (using classes and interfaces).
How do we do this in FP?  Let's model the geometric shapes Circle and Rectangle in Clojure

```
(defrecord Circle [r])
;; this defines a Java class with public final field 'r', i.e. Circle is an immutable value. 

;; I can create a new Circle like this:
(Circle. 11)

;; and I can access the field asif it was a key/value in a hashmap.
(:r (Circle. 11))

;; Similarly:
(defrecord Rect [l w])
```

**BRAMHA** Classes in OO act as containers for structured data, as well as behaviour acting on the contained data.
In Clojure, "records" take care of just the structured-data containers...

### Interfaces translate toâ€¦

**BRAMHA** For each shape, we want to define area + perimeter.  In Clojure, the corollary of an Interface is a Protocol:

```
(defprotocol Shape
  (area [this])
  (perimeter [this]))
```

**BRAMHA** Now, we can extend our Circle/Rect type to implement the Shape protocol

```
(extend-type Circle
  Shape
  (area [circle]
    (* (:r circle) (:r circle) Math/PI)))

(extend-type Rect
  Shape
  (area [rect]
    (* (:l rect) (:w rect))))
```

**BRAMHA** Now we have simple type-based dispatch for our protocol method 'area'

```
(area (Circle. 10))
(area (Rect. 10 20))
```
(this is a limited form of polymorphic dispatch - Clojure has more powerful but less performant polymorhic dispatch through 'multimethods')

### The Expression Problem (Clojure)

**BRAMHA** Now, let's add a new type that implements our existing Shape protocol:

```
(defrecord RightTriangle [b h]
  Shape
  (area [this]
    (/ (* (:b this) (:h this)) 2)))

(area (RightTriangle. 10 100))
```
**BRAMHA** By doing this, we've satisfied the first part of what is called the "Expression Problem" (Phil Wadler '98):

```
(EP1) be able to create new types to implement existing interfaces
This is hardly impressive, all OO languages allow you to create new classes to implement existing interfaces.
```
**BRAMHA** The second part of the Expression Problem, harder to achieve on some OO languages:

```
(EP2) be able to implement a new interface for an existing type
```
**BRAMHA** To achieve (EP2) with Clojure we can do this:

```
(defprotocol Graphic
  (draw [this]))

(extend-type RightTriangle
  Shape
  (draw [this] (puts "***")))
```

**BRAMHA** Moreover (EP1) and (EP2) should be possible without having to recompile the code! This allows for much more flexibility in working with 3rd party code that you 
cannot recompile.

### Expression Problem - 'rows and cols' perspective

**BRAMHA** A useful way of looking at it is: 

```
               area     perimeter     draw
Circle          x          x
Rect            x          x
RightTriangle   x          x          x
```
**BRAMHA** (EP1) is about adding rows (new types), and (EP2) is about adding columns (new operations). In genreal terms, FP langs tend to solve (EP2) better than OO langs.  Dynamic languages like Ruby mitigate the expression problem through "monkey patching" as they have "open classes".  Monkey Patching is where you add or replace existing methods, but one would not know whether such method pre-existed before and there is a name clash.  The very flexibility that these languages offer results in uncertainty.

### Expression Problem - the Scala perspective

**KRISHNA** Lets try to solve the expression problem in Scala. 

~~~
trait Shape
case class Circle(r: Int) extends Shape
case class Rectangle(l: Int, w: Int) extends Shape
~~~

**KRISHNA** Now , let me define set of operations using `trait ShapeOperations[T]`
that I can perform on these shapes - area and perimeter.  If you observe this is
a type class in scala with T as the type parameter.  I then define 2 
implicit object implementations, one for Circle and another for Rectangle that
 do the respective calculations for area and perimeter. 
 
~~~
trait ShapeOperations[T] {
  def area(t: T): Double
  def perimeter(t: T): Double
}

implicit object CircleOperations extends ShapeOperations[Circle] {
  def area(c: Circle): Double = Math.PI * c.r * c.r
  def perimeter(c: Circle): Double = 2 * Math.PI * c.r
}

implicit object RectangleOperations extends ShapeOperations[Rectangle] {
  def area(r: Rectangle): Double = r.l * r.w
  def perimeter(r: Rectangle): Double = 2 * (r.l + r.w)
}

def area[T](t: T)(implicit o: ShapeOperations[T]): Double = o.area(t)
def perimeter[T](t: T)(implicit o: ShapeOperations[T]): Double = o.perimeter(t)
~~~

**KRISHNA**  Finally, I define 2 methods area and perimeter in terms of operations 
defined on type classes and these methods have no knowledge of what the `OperationsFor[Shape]`
are defined.  Also, the parameter `o` is passed as `implicit` so that the compiler can
pick up the appropriate value of `implicit object` in the current scope for that 
type of `T` if its defined.  However, this does not mean that users cannot pass explicit operations.
If they do pass an explicit one, then that will override the implicit values that are
in scope.

I'll just put the above to work here

~~~
val r = Rectangle(2, 3)  
area(r)   //6.0
perimeter(r) //10.0
  
val c = Circle(2)
area(c)  //12.566370614359172
perimeter(c) //12.566370614359172
~~~

**KRISHNA** Let now add a new Operation, say draw.  This is tough in OO,
especially without modification (i.e. no recompile).  Like before, I'll
define another typed `trait Graphics[T]` and then provide implementations 
for Circle and Rectangle.  

~~~
trait Graphics[T] {
  def draw(t: T): Unit
}

implicit object CircleGraphics extends Graphics[Circle] {
  def draw(c: Circle) = println(s"Drawing Circle with ${c.r}...")
}

implicit object RectangleGraphics extends Graphics[Rectangle] {
  def draw(r: Rectangle) = println(s"Drawing Rectangle with Length = ${r.l}, Width = ${r.w}...")
}

def draw[T](t: T)(implicit g: Graphics[T]) = g.draw(t)
~~~

**KRISHNA** If you observe I only write code for the new implementation of `draw`
in both the cases and yet I don't recompile.  I also define another method `draw` 
that consumes a `t` and an implicit `Graphics[T]` object.  Again, this method is 
defined in terms of `g` and its value will be picked up from whatever the scope 
is supplied. If compiler does not find any implicit in the scope, it tries 
searching in the companion object of the type class trait and if it does not 
find there either, it will report an error that it could not find the match 
for that implementation of Graphics[T].  Lets put this one to work now.

~~~
draw(c)  //Drawing Circle with 2...
draw(r)  //Drawing Rectangle with Length = 2, Width = 3...
~~~

**KRISHNA** Lets now add a new type.  This time i'll add RTriangle and create
an implicit object that implements all its methods

~~~
case class RightTriangle(b: Int, h: Int) extends Shape

implicit object RightTriangleOperationsAndGraphics 
  extends ShapeOperations[RightTriangle] with Graphics[RTriangle] {
    def area(rt: RightTriangle) = 0.5 * rt.b * rt.h
    def perimeter(rt: RightTriangle) = rt.b + rt.h + (Math.sqrt(rt.b * rt.b + rt.h * rt.h))
    def draw(rt: RightTriangle) = println(s"Drawing RTriangle with Breadth = ${rt.b} and Height = ${rt.h}...")
}
~~~

**KRISHNA**  Lets put this to work now...

~~~
val rt = RTriangle(2, 3)

area(rt)      //3.0
perimeter(rt) //8.60555127546399
draw(rt)      //Drawing RTriangle with Breadth = 2 and Height = 3...
~~~

**KRISHNA** So this is how using type classes in Scala and using Generics in Java
and without recompile we solved the expression problem.   Also, one thing that I 
observe it that in Clojure, though Shape is a protocol (like interfaces), why
did you not implement the perimeter method?

**BRAMHA** They are optional so that you can define them later, Clojure gives
you that flexibility

**KRISHNA** But then the `defprotocol` is violating protocol...meaning interfaces
are contracts to be respected by the implementing class, they are not supposed to
be optional.

**BRAMHA** Well in Clojure protocol in that sense is a loose contract.

**KRISHNA** Ok i see what you mean.

### The Expression Problem (Haskell)
**BRAMHA** Let see how Haskell addresses the Expression Problem. First, let's create our Shape (algebraic) data type, with a few sub-types:

```
data Shape = Circle {radius :: Float}
           | Rect {length :: Float, width ::Float}
           deriving Show
```

**BRAMHA** To create an area method that is polymorhic over the Shape sub-types:

```
area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = 3.14 * r^2
area (Rect l w) = l * w
```
Similarly, we could write

```
perimeter :: Shape -> Float
perimeter (Circle r) = 2 * 3.14 * r
perimeter (Rect l w) = l + w
```
**BRAMHA** By using an Algebraic type and definining functions on it, we've achieved subtype polymorphism (a simple kind of 'ad-hoc polymorhism'; in contrast to 'parametric polymorhism').

(EP1) Adding a new sub-type to the Shape algebraic type would require adding a clause for the new subtype to each function I declared over the type (implying a recompile). Not very flexible. (EP2) Adding a new function acting on existing algebraic types is trivial.

Instead of unifying the concepts Circle/Rect/... as the Shape abstract data type, we could use Haskell typeclasses to unify the independent algebraic types:
(we use underscore suffix to not name clash with the above code)

```
data Circle_ = Circle_ {radius_ :: Float}
data Rect_ = Rect_ {length_ :: Float, width_ :: Float}

class Shape_ a where
  area_ :: a -> Float
  perimeter_ :: a -> Float

instance Shape_ Circle_ where
  area_         (Circle_ r)  = pi * r^2
  perimeter_    (Circle_ r) = 2 * pi * r

instance Shape_ Rect_ where
  area_          (Rect_ l w)  = l * w
  perimeter_     (Rect_ l w) =  2 * (l + w)
```

**BRAMHA** With typeclasses, adding a new data type and implementing Shape is easy (EP1). 
Adding a new typeclass for an existing type is nice and simple too (EP2).

Clojure protocols have been influenced by Haskell typeclasses. Both Clojure and Haskell fare well with 'solving' the Expression Problem, albeit in their own unique ways.
