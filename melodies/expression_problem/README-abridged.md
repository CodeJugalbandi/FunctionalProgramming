# The expression problem in FP

### Classes translate to...

**BRAMHA** In OO, we model our domain concepts by creating our own types (using classes and interfaces).
How do we do this in FP?  Let's model the geometric shapes Circle and Rectangle in Clojure

```
(defrecord Circle [r])
;; this defines a Java class with public final field 'r', i.e. Circle is an immutable value. 

;; I can create a new Circle like this:
(Circle. 11)

;; and I can access the field asif it was a key/value in a hashmap.
(:r (Circle. 11))

;; Similarly:
(defrecord Rect [l w])
```

**BRAMHA** Classes in OO act as containers for structured data, as well as behaviour acting on the contained data.
In Clojure, "records" take care of just the structured-data containers...

### Interfaces translate toâ€¦

**BRAMHA** For each shape, we want to define area + perimeter.  In Clojure, the corollary of an Interface is a Protocol:

```
(defprotocol Shape
  (area [this])
  (perimeter [this]))
```

**BRAMHA** Now, we can extend our Circle/Rect type to implement the Shape protocol

```
(extend-type Circle
  Shape
  (area [circle]
    (* (:r circle) (:r circle) Math/PI)))

(extend-type Rect
  Shape
  (area [rect]
    (* (:l rect) (:w rect))))
```

**BRAMHA** Now we have simple type-based dispatch for our protocol method 'area'

```
(area (Circle. 10))
(area (Rect. 10 20))
```
(this is a limited form of polymorphic dispatch - Clojure has more powerful but less performant polymorhic dispatch through 'multimethods')

### The Expression Problem (Clojure)

**BRAMHA** Now, let's add a new type that implements our existing Shape protocol:

```
(defrecord RightTriangle [b h]
  Shape
  (area [this]
    (/ (* (:b this) (:h this)) 2)))

(area (RightTriangle. 10 100))
```
**BRAMHA** By doing this, we've satisfied the first part of what is called the "Expression Problem" (Phil Wadler '98):

```
(1) be able to create new types to implement existing interfaces
This is hardly impressive, all OO languages allow you to create new classes to implement existing interfaces.
```
**BRAMHA** The second part of the Expression Problem is more rare to see in languages:

```
(2) be able to implement a new interface for an existing type
```
**BRAMHA** To achieve (2) with Clojure we can do this:
```
(defprotocol Graphic
  (draw [this]))

(extend-type RightTriangle
  Shape
  (draw [this] (puts "***")))
```

**BRAMHA** Moreover (1) and (2) should be possible without having to recompile the code!
This allows for much more flexibility in working with 3rd party code that you 
cannot recompile.

**KRISHNA** Lets try to solve the expression problem in Scala. 
~~~
case class Circle(r: Int)
case class Rectangle(l: Int, w: Int)
~~~

**KRISHNA** Now , let me define set of operations using `trait ShapeOperations[T]`
that I can perform on these shapes - area and perimeter.  If you observe this is
a type class in scala with T as the type parameter. I then define 2 implicit object implementations, one for Circle and another for Rectangle that do the respective calculations for area and perimeter. 
~~~
trait ShapeOperations[T] {
  def area(t: T): Double
  def perimeter(t: T): Double
}

implicit object CircleOperations extends ShapeOperations[Circle] {
  def area(c: Circle): Double = Math.PI * c.r * c.r
  def perimeter(c: Circle): Double = 2 * Math.PI * c.r
}

def area[T](t: T)(implicit o: ShapeOperations[T]): Double = o.area(t)
def perimeter[T](t: T)(implicit o: ShapeOperations[T]): Double = o.perimeter(t)
~~~

**KRISHNA**  Finally, I define 2 methods area and perimeter in terms of operations 
defined on type classes and these methods have no knowledge of what the `OperationsFor[Shape]`
are defined.  Also, the parameter `o` is passed as `implicit` so that the compiler can
pick up the appropriate value of `implicit object` in the current scope for that 
type of `T` if its defined.  However, this does not mean that users cannot pass explicit operations.
If they do pass an explicit one, then that will override the implicit values that are
in scope.

I'll just put the above to work here
~~~
val r = Rectangle(2, 3)  
area(r)   //6.0
perimeter(r) //10.0
  
val c = Circle(2)
area(c)  //12.566370614359172
perimeter(c) //12.566370614359172
~~~

**KRISHNA** Let now add a new Operation, say draw.  This is tough in OO,
especially without modification (i.e. no recompile).  Like before, I'll
define another typed `trait Graphics[T]` and then provide implementations 
for Circle and Rectangle.  
~~~
trait Graphics[T] {
  def draw(t: T): Unit
}

implicit object CircleGraphics extends Graphics[Circle] {
  def draw(c: Circle) = println("O")
}

implicit object RectangleGraphics extends Graphics[Rectangle] {
  def draw(r: Rectangle) = println("[R]")
}

def draw[T](t: T)(implicit g: Graphics[T]) = g.draw(t)
~~~

**KRISHNA** If you observe I only write code for the new implementation of `draw`
in both the cases and yet I don't recompile.  I also define another method `draw` 
that consumes a `t` and an implicit `Graphics[T]` object.  Again, this method is 
defined in terms of `g` and its value will be picked up from whatever the scope 
is supplied. If compiler does not find any implicit in the scope, it tries 
searching in the companion object of the type class trait and if it does not 
find there either, it will report an error that it could not find the match 
for that implementation of Graphics[T].  Lets put this one to work now.
~~~
draw(c)  //Drawing Circle with 2...
draw(r)  //Drawing Rectangle with Length = 2, Width = 3...
~~~

**KRISHNA** So this is how using type classes in Scala and using Generics in Java
and without recompile we solved the expression problem.

**BRAMHA** This was a bit of hard work in Scala! 
Clojure was more concise at it, but for the most beautiful solution, I think Haskell wins! You can see the Haskell solution in the full melody...
