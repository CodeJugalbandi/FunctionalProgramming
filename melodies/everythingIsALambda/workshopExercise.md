### Exercise 1:
* Write a function `square` that consumes a number and produces square of that number
* Write a function `cube` that consumes a number and produces cube of that number.
* How will you DRY up the above functions by using a lambda?

### Exercise 2: 
* Write a function `sum` that consumes a List of numbers and produces a sum of the numbers in that list.
* Write a function `product` that consumes a List of numbers and produces product of numbers in that list.
* How will you DRY up `sum` and `product` functions using a lambda?
